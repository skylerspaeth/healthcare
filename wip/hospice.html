              A Physical Therapist (PT) is a person who is licensed in the examination, evaluation, and treatment of physical impairments through the use of special exercise, application of heat or cold and other physical modalities. The goal is to assist persons who are physically challenged to maximize independence and improve mobility, self-care, and other functional skills necessary for daily living.

            <h1>Occupational Therapist</h1>
            <p>
              Occupational Therapists (OT) help patients improve their ability to perform tasks in living and working environments. They work with individuals who suffer from a mentally, physically, developmentally or emotionally disabling condition. Occupational therapists use treatments to develop, recover or maintain the daily living and work skills of their patients. The therapist helps clients not only to improve their basic motor functions and reasoning abilities, but also to compensate for permanent loss of function. The goal is to help clients have independent, productive and satisfying lives.

                    <hr>
                    <h2>Policy</h2>
                    <p class="hospice-content">Nursing care may be covered on a continuous basis for as much as 24 hours a day during periods of crisis as necessary to maintain the patient at home. Either homemaker or Hospice aide services or both may be covered on a 24-hour continuous basis during periods of crisis. However, care during these periods must be predominantly nursing care. A period of crisis is a period in which the individual requires continuous care to achieve palliation or management of acute medical symptoms.</p>
                    <h2>Procedure</h2>
                    <p class="hospice-content">Continuous Care is a short-term intervention for a medical crisis to manage acute medical symptoms during the terminal phase of illness. The need for continuous care and the skill level of Hospice personnel needed in the home will be evaluated by the Director and documented in the patient record. Continuous home care will be available to patients with the Medicare benefit, or as other payers allow. Verification of coverage or ability to pay must be made for all private pay and insurance patients prior to instituting continuous care services.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>A minimum of eight hours of care must be provided during a 24-hour day that begins and ends at midnight. This care need not be continuous, e.g., four hours could be provided in the morning and another four hours provided in the evening on the same day.</li>
                      <li>Continuous care will be provided to achieve palliation or to manage acute medical symptoms in order to maintain the patient at home.</li>
                      <li>The patientâ€™s predominant need must be nursing intervention by licensed Hospice employees, although Hospice aide services may also be provided. A nurse must provide fifty-one percent of this care.</li>
                      <li>Crisis situations which may require continuous care include, but are not limited to:</li>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Uncontrolled, severe symptoms (e.g., pain, dyspnea, nausea and vomiting) which require continuous nursing assessment, intervention and evaluation.</li>
                          <li>When a function necessary for safe medical management has to be performed and monitored continuously and/or closely (e.g., IV-related care).</li>
                          <li>If the patient meets the criteria for an acute inpatient general admission, but cannot or will not agree to be moved.</li>
                          <li>Severe and almost continuous seizures</li>
                          <li>Hemorrhaging</li>
                          <li>Severe anxiety, agitation, or confusion which poses a safety threat</li>
                          <li>Suicidal ideation or related action</li>
                          <li>Caregiver is temporarily unable to fulfill the caregiver role or there is an increased need for caregiver. The caregiver must remain available during periods of continuous care.</li>
                        </ul>
                      <li>The RN is responsible for assessing the patientâ€™s need for a higher level of care or short-term continuous care. Assessment is confirmed with the Director, physician and IDG members.</li>
                      <li>Continuous care is provided to meet short-term medical crisis. An order is obtained from the physician. Specific goals should be detailed in the orders for continuous care, e.g., to manage IV pain management.</li>
                      <li>The Director in conjunction with the RN will determine the skill level of care required to meet the patientâ€™s needs.</li>
                      <li>The RN or designee will:</li>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Revise the plan of care to indicate the change in level of care to continuous care and review the plan with all staff, family and volunteers.</li>
                          <li>Coordinate and evaluate the care provided by all staff and volunteers</li>
                          <li>Update Aide assignments as needed</li>
                          <li>Monitor the patient progress toward meeting the established goals</li>
                          <li>Maintain communication between IDG and patient/family/ caregiver</li>
                          <li>Contact the physician and report any changes in the patientâ€™s condition and/or achievement of defined goals for continuous care.</li>
                        </ul>
                      <li>Complete documentation of the care provided will be recorded hourly and added to the patient record.</li>
                      <li>The RN, Director, physician and IDG members will determine when continuous care is no longer necessary. A physician order will be obtained to discontinue continuous care.</li>
